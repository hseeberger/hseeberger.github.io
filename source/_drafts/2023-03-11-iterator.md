At work I was recently asked to implement some data transformation pipeline for some pretty massive data volumes. A substantial part of the task was creating the custom `partitioned` combinator to "locally" partition a stream: a stream of streams where each sub-stream/partition produces items with an identical key (determined by a given function). As soon as an item has a new key, the current sub-stream/partition is exhausted, i.e. produces no more items, and a new one is produced by the partitioned stream of streams. I call this "locally" partitioned, because it is possible that a later partition has the same key as a former one, as long as there is at least one in between with a different key.

Given my background with Akka, in particular with Akka Streams, I did not even consider using a synchronous approach, but immediately went for the async machinery, because I thought that "stream processing" requires using async `Stream`s.

All worked well, but a colleague of mine, who had little experience with async, not only was confused by the code, but rightly questioned whether the async approach had any advantages over the synchronous one for the given use case. This made me realize that there of course is a synchronous way of "stream processing": `Iterator`s!

Therefore I reimplemented the `Stream` combinator for `Iterator` and this again made me realize how closely `Iterator` and `Stream` are related and totally convinced me of the [renaming](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3208) of `Stream` to `AsyncIterator`.

In the following I will show major parts of the `partitioned` implementation for both `Iterator` and `Stream` as well as the similarities and differences.

First let's take a look at two respective test cases to show how `partitioned` is supposed to work:

### Iterator version

```rust
#[test]
fn test_partitioned() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5].into_iter();
    let partitioned = numbers.partitioned(|n| *n);
    let result = partitioned
        .map(|partition| partition.collect::<Vec<_>>())
        .collect::<Vec<_>>();
    assert_eq!(
        result,
        vec![vec![1], vec![2, 2], vec![3, 3, 3], vec![4], vec![5, 5]]
    );
}
```

### Stream version

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_partitioned() {
    let numbers = stream::iter(vec![1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5]);
    let partitioned = numbers.partitioned(|n| *n);
    let result = partitioned
        .then(|partition| partition.collect::<Vec<_>>())
        .collect::<Vec<_>>()
        .await;
    assert_eq!(
        result,
        vec![vec![1], vec![2, 2], vec![3, 3, 3], vec![4], vec![5, 5]]
    );
}
```

All right, now that we have seen `partitioned` in action, let's take a look at the implementations, starting with the respective structs:

### Iterator version

```rust
pub struct Partitioned<I, F, K>
where
    I: Iterator,
{
    upstream: Rc<RefCell<ZipWithNext<I>>>,
    make_key: F,
    key: Option<K>,
}
```

### Stream version

```rust
#[pin_project]
pub struct Partitioned<S, F, K>
where
    S: Stream,
{
    upstream: Arc<RwLock<ZipWithNext<S>>>,
    make_key: F,
    key: Option<K>,
}
```

As you can see, the shape of the structs is identical. The main differences are the use of `Rc` and `RefCell` for the single-threaded `Iterator` version and `Arc` and `RwLock` for the `Stream` version as well as the use of the `pin_project` attribute macro for the `Stream` version. By the way, `ZipWithNext` is another custom combinator which tuples up each item with, well, the next one wrapped in an `Option`, because there might not be one.

Now let's compare the `Iterator` and `Stream` implementations for the respective structs:

### Iterator version

```rust
impl<I, F, K> Iterator for Partitioned<I, F, K>
where
    I: Iterator,
    I::Item: Clone,
    F: Fn(&I::Item) -> K + Copy,
    K: Debug + Eq,
{
    type Item = Partition<I, F>;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        // Get first and second item, validate that first item has key different from previous
        // partition, create next partition with first and second item.
        match self.upstream.borrow_mut().next() {
            Some((current, next)) => {
                let key = (self.make_key)(&current);
                if self.key.as_ref().map(|k| k == &key).unwrap_or_default() {
                    panic!("Partition with key `{key:?}` not consumed");
                }
                self.key.replace(key);

                Some(Partition {
                    upstream: self.upstream.clone(),
                    make_key: self.make_key,
                    current,
                    next,
                    terminated: false,
                })
            }

            None => None,
        }
    }
}
```

The `Iterator` implementation tries to get the next tuple of items from the original stream "zipped with next". If there is one, it validates that the first item has a key different from the previous partition and the creates the next partition passing along the first and second item.


### Stream version

```rust
impl<S, F, K> Stream for Partitioned<S, F, K>
where
    S: Stream + Unpin,
    S::Item: Clone,
    F: Fn(&S::Item) -> K + Copy,
    K: Debug + Eq,
{
    type Item = Partition<S, F>;

    fn poll_next(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Option<Self::Item>> {
        let this = self.project();

        // Get first and second item, validate that first item has key different from previous
        // partition, create next partition with first and second item.
        match this.upstream.write().poll_next_unpin(cx) {
            Poll::Ready(Some((first, second))) => {
                let key = (this.make_key)(&first);
                if this.key.as_ref().map(|k| k == &key).unwrap_or_default() {
                    panic!("Partition with key `{key:?}` not consumed");
                }
                this.key.replace(key);

                Poll::Ready(Some(Partition {
                    upstream: this.upstream.clone(),
                    make_key: *this.make_key,
                    current: first,
                    next: second,
                    terminated: false,
                }))
            }

            Poll::Ready(None) => Poll::Ready(None),

            Poll::Pending => Poll::Pending,
        }
    }
}
```

The `Stream` implementation applies the same logic like the above `Iterator` one, but it has to adhere to the "specifics of async", in particular to using `Pin` and methods returning `Poll`. Therefore we use the `project` method generated by the `pin_project` attribute macro to get mutable references for the struct fields, e.g. for `upstream`.
