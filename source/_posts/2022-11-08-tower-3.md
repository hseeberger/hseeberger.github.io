In the [previous episode](/2022/10/22/2022-10-23-tower-2) we have seen how to call a Tower service. In particular we have discussed the contract between `poll_ready` and `call`: callers must first invoke `poll_ready` until it returns `Poll::Ready` before they invoke `call`, else `call` might panic.

Of course some services, e.g. the `EchoService` described in the [first episode](/2022/10/20/2022-10-21-tower-1), are always ready and therefore invokig `call` without `poll_ready` works fine.

But generally the internal state or external dependencies, e.g. database connections, can infuence the readiness of a service. Also, composing domain services with middleware, e.g. with a rate limit or a circuit breaker, naturally effect the readiness.

To demonstrate this, let's take a look at a service which alternates between ready and not ready:

```rust
/// AlternatingReady service, responding to a [AlternatingReadyRequest] with an
/// [AlternatingReadyResponse].
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct AlternatingReadyService {
    ready: bool,
}

/// Tower `Service` implementation for [AlternatingReadyService]: readiness alternates between
/// pending and ready, calls never fail and responses are ready immediately.
impl Service<AlternatingReadyRequest> for AlternatingReadyService {
    type Response = AlternatingReadyResponse;

    /// This service never fails.
    type Error = Infallible;

    /// Responses of this service are ready immediately.
    type Future = Ready<Result<Self::Response, Self::Error>>;

    /// Alternately return `Poll::Pending` and `Poll::Ready`.
    fn poll_ready(&mut self, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Result<(), Self::Error>> {
        if self.ready {
            // Wake up the task to make sure the executor calls `poll_ready` again.
            cx.waker().wake_by_ref();

            self.ready = false;
            Poll::Pending
        } else {
            self.ready = true;
            Poll::Ready(Ok(()))
        }
    }

    /// Always return [AlternatingReadyResponse].
    ///
    /// # Panics
    /// Panics if called without prior calling `poll_ready`.
    fn call(&mut self, _req: AlternatingReadyRequest) -> Self::Future {
        if !self.ready {
            panic!("service not ready; poll_ready must be called first");
        }
        self.ready = false;
        ready(Ok(AlternatingReadyResponse))
    }
}
```

The `AlternatingReadyService` tracks its readiness via the `ready` field. `poll_ready` is implemented such that, if the service has been ready before, it sets it as not ready and returns `Poll::Pending`; and vice versa. Also, `call` takes the `ready` field into account such that invoking `call` results in panicking if the service is not ready.

Of course this implementation is highly constructed, but it serves well to demonstrate the importance of the contract between `poll_ready` and `call`:

```rust
let mut service = AlternatingReadyService::new();

let service = service.ready().await?;
let _response = service.call(AlternatingReadyRequest).await?;

// We should invoke `ready` once again before invoking `call`!
// service.ready().await?;
let _response = service.call(AlternatingReadyRequest).await?;
```

In this example the second `call` fails with a panic, because the first one, or rather the `ready` invocation, leaves the service as not ready. If you want to check this out yourself, you can find the full code at [tower-experiments on GitHub](https://github.com/hseeberger/tower-experiments).
